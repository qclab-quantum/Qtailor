## Requirements

We recommend **Anaconda** as Python environment manager

For Linux , you can  install Pytorch  by run:

```setup
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

Guide of install Pytorch on **Windows** or with GPU  is available at [Pytorch Get Started](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

## Get started

1. download code

```
git clone https://github.com/qclab-quantum/Qtailor.git
```

2. install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

you have the option to utilize the default settings or customize the important items in the config.xml :

```
# traing iterations
iters_arr
  - 5
  
# relative path of  store in benchmark folder
circuits:
  -qft\\qft_indep_qiskit_5.qasm
  
# about 0.5x the number of CPU cores, for laptop you can set to 4
num_rollout_workers: 4
```



## Training

To train the model, run this command:

```train
python rllib_run.py
```

>ðŸ“‹  When training complete the training result will be automatically saved in **benchmark/a-result/xxx.csv**.
> The column **'rl'** means the depth of mapped circuits results from our method, the column 'results'  results represents the lower left corner of the matrix , as we mention in **Section 2.1 (line 92)**

## Evaluation

To evaluate the result,

1. Open utils/benchmark.py  and modify the main function

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':

    array  = []

    qasm = 'portfolio_vqe/portfoliovqe_indep_qiskit_10.qasm'

    Benchmark.compare_gates(qasm=qasm,array=array,bits = 10)
```

2. Replace the existing values with those retrieved from the **benchmark/a-result/xxx.csv**. the csv file looks like:

3. Run the main Function in your editor , or  run:

   ```shell
   python utils/benchmark.py
   ```



## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on circuits depth :
